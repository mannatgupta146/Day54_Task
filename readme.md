# Day 54 Task | Cohort 2.0

This project is my **Day 53 Task**, where I created a smooth **Matrix-style Text Scramble Hover Effect** using **HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript**.  
When the user hovers over the text, each character scrambles into random symbols and then resolves back into the original text, creating a clean hacker-style animation.

## 🎥 Demo
Below is a quick preview of how the animation looks:

## 📌 About the Day 53 Task
Day 53 focused on building an interactive **text scrambling and decoding effect**. I learned how to:

- Generate random characters for the scramble effect  
- Replace text letter-by-letter with JavaScript  
- Control animation smoothness using intervals  
- Apply neon green matrix color styling  
- Trigger animation on mouseenter events  
- Use SCSS nesting for organized styling  

## ✨ Task Features
